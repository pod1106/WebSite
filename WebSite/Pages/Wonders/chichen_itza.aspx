            Ancient Origins
        </h2>

        <p>
            Chichen Itza was a large pre-Columbian city built by the Maya civilization in the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico. It was one of the largest Maya cities and is believed to have been a major regional capital from around AD 600 to 1200. The name "Chichen Itza" translates to "At the mouth of the well of the Itza," referring to the nearby cenotes, which provided water to the city. It was a center for political, economic, and religious activity in the Maya world. The city's decline began before the arrival of the Spanish, and it became largely abandoned by the time of their conquest.

            Architectural Feats
        </h2>

        <p>
            Chichen Itza is famous for its impressive architecture, most notably the pyramid known as El Castillo or the Temple of Kukulkan. The pyramid was built with 91 steps on each of its four sides, and when combined with the platform at the top, the total number of steps equals 365, symbolizing the days of the solar year. The architecture of Chichen Itza reveals advanced knowledge of astronomy, mathematics, and construction techniques. Other important structures include the Great Ball Court, the Temple of the Warriors, and the Caracol observatory, which was used for tracking celestial events.

        </h2>

        <p>
            Chichen Itza was a religious, cultural, and commercial hub for the Maya civilization. The Temple of Kukulkan, in particular, is thought to have played a key role in ceremonies and astronomical events, such as the spring and autumn equinoxes, when the shadow of the serpent god appears to descend the pyramid. The site also played an important role in the region's trade networks, connecting the Maya to other Mesoamerican cultures. Its significance extends beyond the Maya, as Chichen Itza became a symbol of Mexico's ancient civilizations and is now one of the New Seven Wonders of the World.

        <p>
            Today, Chichen Itza is one of the most visited archaeological sites in Mexico, attracting millions of tourists each year. It was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1988, helping to ensure its preservation and restoration. The site remains a major cultural and historical symbol of the Maya civilization and is a focal point for learning about pre-Columbian history. Efforts continue to preserve the structures and protect them from erosion and damage caused by the large number of visitors.

        </h2>

        <p>
            Chichen Itza’s builders were not only master architects but also skilled astronomers. The city’s layout, particularly the Temple of Kukulkan, is aligned with key astronomical events, such as solstices and equinoxes. The Caracol observatory, with its round structure and narrow slits, was used for observing the movement of the stars and planets. The Maya people used these observations to create highly accurate calendars, making Chichen Itza not only a religious and political center but also a hub for scientific exploration.
