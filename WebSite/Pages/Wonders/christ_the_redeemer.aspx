            History
        </h2>

        <p>
            Christ the Redeemer, the iconic statue towering over Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, was conceived in the mid-19th century as a symbol of faith and peace. The idea for the statue was first proposed by the Catholic Circle of Rio in 1859, with the aim of creating a landmark to represent Christianity in the country. However, the actual construction only began in the mid-1920s, and the project was championed by Catholic priest Pedro Maria Boss, who envisioned a monumental statue atop the Corcovado mountain.
            <br>
            The statue’s creation was also influenced by a growing sense of nationalism and a desire to showcase Brazilian pride on the global stage. After many years of fundraising and planning, the statue was finally inaugurated on October 12, 1931, and quickly became one of the most recognizable landmarks in the world.

            Construction and Design
        </h2>

        <p>
            The construction of Christ the Redeemer was a monumental task, both in terms of engineering and design. The statue stands 98 feet (30 meters) tall, with arms that span 92 feet (28 meters), making it one of the largest statues of Jesus in the world. Designed by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, the statue is made of reinforced concrete and covered in a mosaic of soapstone, chosen for its durability and smooth texture.
            <br>
            The statue was constructed on the top of the Corcovado mountain, which posed several challenges, including the transportation of materials and the need for innovative techniques to secure the statue in place. The project was completed in just five years, with the final result being a stunning combination of art, engineering, and religious symbolism. Christ the Redeemer’s arms outstretched in a welcoming embrace symbolize the love and peace of Christ extending over the city of Rio de Janeiro.
